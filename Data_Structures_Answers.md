Add your answers to the questions below.

1. What is the runtime complexity of your ring buffer's `append` method?
    * Constant time - O(c)

2. What is the space complexity of your ring buffer's `append` function?
    * The space complexity is O(n) for n = self.capacity

3. What is the runtime complexity of your ring buffer's `get` method?
    * The runetime complexity is O(n) for n = self.capacity since you need to loop through the whole array

4. What is the space complexity of your ring buffer's `get` method?
    * The space complexity is O(n) for n = self.capacity

5. What is the runtime complexity of the provided code in `names.py`?
    * The provided code is O(n^2) since it is running nested loops.

6. What is the space complexity of the provided code in `names.py`?
    * The provided code's space complexity is O(2n)  

7. What is the runtime complexity of your optimized code in `names.py`?
    * The code is O(log n) since it uses a binary search tree

8. What is the space complexity of your optimized code in `names.py`?
    * The provided code's space complexity is O(n)
